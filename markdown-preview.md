Markdown-preview show case in 40 minutes?
=========================================

**Markdown is cool! Meteor is cool!**

Yesterday we argued about (or actually it was a vote on our intranet) whether [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a good choice for editing local blog-posts (on our intranet).

I love markdown, and have used it for at least 5 years for all my local notetaking etc.

So I set out a challenge for my self:

* Can I make a showcase for it?
* Can I make it in Meteor (currently the most interesting web project out there, in my opinion)
* (Bonus) Can I make the showcase, and deploy it to the world in 40 minutes? (The time box is my daily commute to work, going by SJ-train from Uppsala to Stockholm (Sweden)

Acceptance criteria:

1. Small app with editor pane and preview pane
1. Preview pane should be instantly updated when content is changed in editor pane
1. Self contained blogpost deplyed to the meteor cloud (available to _the world_)

(yes, in markdown you write *1.* for all elemnts in a bullet list...)

Get going...
------------
07:14 - That means I have about 36 minutes to go

(Start googling...I know that Meteor should have markdown built in, or atlest almost built in...)

"Knivsta, next station!" (train personell in the speaker system)
------------------------------------------------------

(That means I have about 30 minutes to go)

[One of the first hits on stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17030845/how-does-one-actually-use-markdown-with-meteor)

    meteor add showdown

"Märsta, next station!" (train personell in the speaker system)
------------------------------------------------------

Ouch...already Märsta - that means I have 20 minutes left...)

Bang! Found what I wanted:

[reactive variable to capture user input](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17181405/reactive-variable-to-capture-user-input-meteor)

That's almost exactly what I looked for.
Will I have time to implement it?

(Almost there... but the clock says 7:48..."Next Stockholm station!")

Damn! Timebox was a little bit to short!

Need about 30 min more to...

* Go through my writing (and actually make this a blog post)
* Use more markdown syntax variants (to make my point)
* Fix basic styling (css)

_To be continued_
